# Dutch auction things off when negative balance

When negative balance give warning period to go in good standing, and don't let
further buys happen. When warning period over, freeze account and have a dutch
auction (decrease your selling price of everything by 1% every minute (or maybe
30 seconds)). Also announce the auction so that other players know about it.

Unfreeze account and restore prices as soon as person reaches a positive balance

# Warn person before they go bankrupt, maybe like a minute before the auction

# Don't delete old schema upgrade instead

# BUG: If you buy a one of a kind thing the price is set to a new calculated
  price instead of the price you bought it at (because removing it from the
  market means it has no more value)

# BUG: Wear and metadata is ignore, so if you buy a broken tool, you will get a
  fixed tool. I should probably use wear and metadata as keys in the auction
  somehow (or make wear linearly cheaper). Or probably just ignore them because
  it is easier.

Make sure everything is in a namespace (even small utility functions)
