# Before releasing check invariants.txt

# Dutch auction things off when negative balance

When negative balance give warning period to go in good standing, and don't let
further buys happen. When warning period over, freeze account and have a dutch
auction (decrease your selling price of everything by 1% every minute (or maybe
30 seconds)). Also announce the auction so that other players know about it.

Unfreeze account and restore prices as soon as person reaches a positive balance

# Warn person before they go bankrupt, maybe like a minute before the auction

# Don't delete old schema upgrade instead
